# CodeQuiz
Code Quiz designed for homework in UCSD coding bootcamp

This is a timed quiz with the objective being to answer as many questions correctly and as quickly as possible.

Once the user chooses to begin the quiz, they will have three minutes (180 seconds) to answer 10 questions. 
If the user answers a question incorrectly, they will have 15 seconds docked from the remaining time. Correct
answers will sound a noise and text to signal their choice, as will an incorrect choice respectively. 

The quiz will end once the user has either answered all the questions or has run out of time. The user's score
will be determined by the remaining time at the end of the quiz. The user will also have the option to enter
their name into a textarea to be entered into local storage, along with their score.

There is a seperate layout for the stored names and scores the user can access at the end of the quiz or before
they begin a new one. This layout also has the option to delete all stored scores if they so choose from local
storage.
